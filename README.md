This is a Nano with a ULN2003 daughterboard for driving an animated ore boat unloader diorama. There are 6 3d printed booms which swing from the hold of the Ore Boat to waiting gondolas. Each boom has a controller which controls its stepper motor and reads a hall effect sensor for registration.

Earl is an MMR who specializes in very detailed structures and indusrial facilities with animation.
